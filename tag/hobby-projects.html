</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>My only new years resolution this year was to read more books. Over the past couple of years, I had 
essentially stopped reading books, and that realization was not a joyous one. Reading books 
is a fun way to both learn and be entertained. Jhumpa Lahiri had a 
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/76236-that-s-the-thing-about-books-they-let-you-travel-without">good quote</a> 
in The Namesake: <code>That's the thing about books. They let you travel without moving your feet.</code> 
I'm happy to say, that so far, I've maintained my resolution, having finished 
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4865.How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People">two</a> 
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7069.The_World_According_to_Garp">books</a> already 
and am onto my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow">third one</a>.</p>
<p>Anyways, since I have a subscription to the Oakland Library, I figured it'd be better for me to borrow 
the books I want to read as opposed to buying them each time (even though it's fun to fill out a 
bookshelf). At the same time, I started keeping track of books I want to read on 
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a> (the shelves they have, along with the ability to order 
the books makes it a useful utility for me). The first book I borrowed from the library was 
Thinking Fast and Slow and the process of me finding a copy to borrow left me wanting for a 
better way to locate and hold a book. The story goes something like this: find the 
next book I want to read from my GR shelf, search on the oakland library website for it's 
availability, find out that it's not available, rinse and repeat until one
becomes available (took me a few days). The putting it on hold was particulary important 
since I had one occasion where I saw the book was available at a particular branch, 
immdiately left to go pick it up (without putting it on hold) and by the time I 
reached there (~15 minutes), someone had already borrowed it. I eventually did find a copy 
at a different branch but I really wanted a better way of doing things.</p>
<p>The solution to my problem was to build an API that accesses the Oakland Library Catalog (they 
don't really have an API, so this library scrapes their website) and combine it with the 
published API from GR (xml, really) to tell me whether the books on my shelf are available 
at the library or not (and more in the future). At the same time, working on this project 
gave me the opportunity to learn and use Python3, something I hadn't really done until now 
(for no good reason besides laziness).</p>
<h1>Building an "API" for the Oakland Library Catalog</h1>
<p>To be able to search their catalog programatically, I had to write a simple scraper. This 
was done using the awesome <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/">requests</a> library 
for making the http requests and the equally awesome 
<a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautilfulSoup</a> library to parse the HTML 
response to find the elements I'm looking for. The code for all of this is available on 
<a href="https://github.com/rmanocha/oaklibsearcher/blob/master/oaklibapi/api.py">github</a> and 
should be fairly easy to follow. The <em>oaklibapi</em> module is intended to be an API module 
though and, if needed, can be imported into other projects as well. Some sample code showing 
how to use it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">In</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">oaklibapi</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">OaklandLibraryAPI</span>

</pre></div>


<p>That's all there is to it as of now. I need to add a couple more enhancements, specifically 
around <a href="https://github.com/rmanocha/oaklibsearcher/issues/3">retreiving the number of books available</a> 
as well as <a href="https://github.com/rmanocha/oaklibsearcher/issues/6">the branches they're available at</a>.</p>
<p>An interesting bit to note here is that BeautifulSoup since v4 has started giving users the option to 
specify a parser. I ended up using the the <a href="http://lxml.de/">lxml parser</a> for this since I had to use it 
to parse XML from the GR api anyways. I didn't benchmark things, but as documented, and based on my 
very non-scientific observations, I did perceive an improvement in instantiating the <code>OaklandLibraryAPI</code> 
class.</p>
<h1>Integrating with the Goodreads API</h1>
<p>Fortunately, GR does <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/api">publish an API</a>. It does seem rather antiquated 
though - responses are in XML (some are in JSON, which is weird too; why do only some of the 
resources return either XML or JSON while most only return XML) and there are no official 
client libraries. There are <a href="https://github.com/sefakilic/goodreads/">libraries</a> 
<a href="https://github.com/dasevilla/goodreads-python">available</a> on github. None of them really did what 
I wanted them to do though (albeit, I only spent a short amount of time looking) and since it was 
fairly easy to query the API and parse the response myself, I just ended up doing so, instead of 
using one of the available libraries.</p>
<p>My goal with this API was to simply retrieve my 
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/75811584?shelf=to-read">"to-read" bookshelf</a>. It took me 
some time to figure out that I had to use the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/api/index#reviews.list">reviews.list</a> 
resource for this (go figure). Only other thing to note here that BeautifulSoup does not seem to have a 
default parser for XML documents. I had to explicitly define <em>lxml</em> while parsing the response from the API 
(as opposed to HTML, which does seem to have a default parser, which does throw a big &amp; ugly warning when 
not overridden though).</p>
<p>Here's some sample code on how to use <em>GoodreadsQueryAPI</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">In</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">goodreads_api</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">GoodreadsQueryAPI</span>

<p>Of-course, many improvements can be made to the interface, but this works for a v0.1 :). I think it'd also be good to 
be able to pull <a href="https://github.com/rmanocha/oaklibsearcher/issues/1">the name of the author</a> as well as ordering 
the books in the response by <a href="https://github.com/rmanocha/oaklibsearcher/issues/10">position defined by the user</a>.</p>
<h1>Putting it all together</h1>
<p>Having the API for the library and Goodreads makes it easy for us to put everything together. Grabbing the list of 
books in the GR shelf followed by querying each one to see it's availability is 
<a href="https://github.com/rmanocha/oaklibsearcher/blob/master/oaklibsearcher.py">done already</a>. 
<em>GOODREADS_ACCESS_KEY</em> and <em>GOODREADS_USER_ID</em> is read in from <em>settings.py</em> (a template for that is 
<a href="https://github.com/rmanocha/oaklibsearcher/blob/master/settings.py-def">available</a>). For now, it simply 
spits out the list of books along with it's availability (like below). A good v1.0 would be to implement 
some form of a <a href="https://github.com/rmanocha/oaklibsearcher/issues/11">notification system</a>.</p>
